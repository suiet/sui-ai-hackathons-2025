# SuiGuard: AI-Powered Security Agent for NFT Scam Detection


## Sui Agent Typhoon


### Project Overview


SuiGuard is an intelligent AI agent that protects the Sui ecosystem from NFT-related scams and fraudulent activities. By leveraging GPT-4V's multimodal capabilities, our agent provides real-time security analysis of NFT listings, protecting users from sophisticated scams that traditional rule-based systems might miss.

### Why This Matters

- NFT scams resulted in millions of dollars in losses across blockchains in 2023
- Traditional security measures can't keep up with evolving scam tactics
- Manual verification is time-consuming and error-prone
- Current solutions lack AI-powered visual and contextual analysis

### Technical Architecture


#### 1. AI Agent Core

- Integration with GPT-4V for multimodal analysis
- Custom-trained security policies for blockchain-specific threats
- Real-time image and metadata validation
- Pattern recognition for suspicious hosting patterns

#### 2. Sui Integration

- Direct integration with Sui blockchain using Move
- Real-time monitoring of NFT object creation and transfers
- Kiosk integration for marketplace safety
- zkLogin integration for secure reporting

#### 3. Reporting System

- Automated threat categorization
- Google Sheets integration for transparent tracking
- Community-driven reporting mechanism
- Real-time alerts for marketplace operators

### Innovation Points

1. **Multi-Modal Analysis**
	- Visual content verification using GPT-4V
	- Text analysis of NFT metadata and descriptions
	- URL and hosting pattern analysis
	- Cross-referencing with known scam patterns
2. **Automated Classification**
	- Predefined security categories (S1: Fraudulent content)
	- Machine learning-based pattern detection
	- Confidence scoring system
	- False positive minimization
3. **Real-Time Protection**

	- Proactive scam detection
	- Automated marketplace alerts
	- User warning system

### Technical Implementation


```go
// Example of our core validation logic
func ValidateNFTImage(title, description, imageUrl string) (isSafe bool, invalidateCategories []string, err error) {
    // Multi-modal AI analysis using GPT-4V
    // URL pattern analysis
    // Hosting verification
    // Scam pattern detection
}
```
